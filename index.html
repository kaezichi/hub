      <p>
        I wish I could look at you without having to look at you with so much love.
        I wish I could just stare at you and you wouldn't notice.
        But I just wish I wouldn't, beacuse I can't.
      </p>
      <p>
        I miss the way you looked at me when I wasn’t looking. I miss your voice saying my name like it meant something.  
        I miss the comfort I didn’t even know I had.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I know I'm starting to go back to my old ways, I'm sorry for that. I want to be with you, even just as friends. 
        But, I can't. My heart can't. I get hurt if I pick you, I get hurt if I don't. I don't even know where to stand.
        All I know is that I want to stand with you. I'm getting way too comfortable again, I can't hide it anymore. 
        I just want it to stop, I just want it to go away so that I can go back to being just you're "friend."
        But who am I even kidding? I know it won't stop. I have loved you for so long, and maybe that's why I still do.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to be someone in your life. Even if it's just a friend.
        Because you are someone to me. Someone I love so dearly and so much that it makes my head ache.
