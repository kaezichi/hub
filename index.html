      <p>
        I wish I could take back every word I left unsaid.  
        I wish I could’ve loved you better — louder — softer. All at once.  
        But this isn’t about what I wish I did.  
        It’s about what I still feel.
      </p>
      <p>
        I miss the way you looked at me when I wasn’t looking. I miss your voice saying my name like it meant something.  
        I miss the comfort I didn’t even know I had.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I know I made things unclear. I know I hurt you, even if I never meant to.  
        I carry that with me, and I’m sorry.
      </p>
      <p>
        But more than anything—I want to still be someone in your life. Even if it's just a friend.  
        Because you are still someone to me. Someone I love.
